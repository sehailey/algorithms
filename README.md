# Studying Algorithms

This is a personal repo I'm making for myself to practice algorithms. I find that making commits to a project helps me stay organized in my thoughts and my efforts. I hope to add resources that I find useful as I write out solutions to common algorithms and reflect on my approach along the way.

In addition, where it makes sense, I will practice some test-driven development using Mocha and Chai along the way. Writing tests is a slog. They take forever to write and when the problems are simple it feels like overkill, but I'm hoping that working on algorithms and testing at the same time will make both come more naturally until they are second nature.

I'll be focusing on these areas:

    * Arrays
    * Stacks & Queues
    * Linked Lists
    * Hash Tables
    * Trees & Heaps
    * Graphs
